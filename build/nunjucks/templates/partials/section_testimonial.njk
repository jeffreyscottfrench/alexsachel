      I love to shop and end up buying lots of pieces and then not knowing the best way to put them together to make outfits. I got to the point where my closets were packed with clothes and I was feeling totally overwhelmed and having difficulty even getting dressed. I had never worked with a personal stylist before and was hesitant about having someone help me with my closet (even my husband is banned from my closet). But Alex is so easy, non-judgmental, and fun to work with that I felt very comfortable and the whole process was wonderful!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was Alex extremely thorough, she was also very organized and efficient. I was so impressed by all that she accomplished in our first session!
    </p>
    <ul class="paragraph__half">
      <li>We went through everything in my closets and determined which items to keep, to consign, or to donate.
      </li>
      <li>Alex then organized my entire wardrobe, helped me style outfits (including shoes and accessories!) from the pieces I was keeping, and even took reference photos to help me easily decide and dress for future occasions.
      </li>
      <li>Finally she identified any gaps in my wardrobe that I needed to fill, and we made a plan to get those pieces.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph__half">
      After managing my closet, we went shopping together to purchase a few items that were missing in my wardrobe, and Alex will also text me if she sees things when we aren't shopping toghether. She always seems to know exactly what I'll like! Since I began working with Alex, I’m more confident creating outfits using the clothes I already own, and when I do pick up a new piece, I know exactly how to integrate it into my wardrobe. I’ve been receiving so many compliments!
      <span class="fake__break">
        Alex is amazing!! I can truly say this has been a life-changing experience for me, and I know everyone could benefit from her incredible talent and expertise. I highly recommend Alex, and look forward to continuing to work together!<span class="pullquote__credit"> - M.</span>
