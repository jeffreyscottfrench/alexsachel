      "I absolutely love working with Alex!! She is extremely talented, professional, and very good at what she does. She has a great eye and had my style pegged from the first time we met!
    </p>
    <p class="width__full">
      I love to shop and end up buying lots of pieces and then not knowing the best way to put them together to make outfits. I got to the point where my closets were packed with clothes and I was feeling totally overwhelmed and having difficulty even getting dressed. I had never worked with a personal stylist before and was hesitant about having someone help me with my closet (even my husband is banned from my closet). But Alex is so easy, non-judgmental, and fun to work with that I felt very comfortable and the whole process was wonderful!!
      <br><br>
      Not only was Alex extremely thorough, she was also very organized and efficient. I was so impressed by all that she accomplished in our first session, which was just one afternoon!
    </p>
    <ul class="width__half--left">
      <li>
        We went through everything in my closets and determined which items should stay and which ones needed to go, and then further separated the to go items into those to be donated and those to be consigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, she organized my closet ... which I love! She helped me style outfits from pieces I already had (including shoes and accessories) and took photos to create a picture book of looks for different occasions. This was my favorite part, I constantly use these photos as a reference guide when I’m getting dressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        She also identified any gaps in my wardrobe that I needed to fill.
      </li>
    </ul>

      After the initial session we went on one quick shopping trip to purchase a few items that were missing in my wardrobe. She has also texted me when she sees something that she thinks I would like and tells me where to get it. She always seems to know exactly what I like!
      <br><br>
      I’m thrilled because now when I walk into my closet, there are fewer pieces, but I love everything in there and know how to put the pieces together to create outfits that I enjoy and feel confident wearing ... and I’ve been receiving so many compliments! And this process is definitely cost-effective – after working with Alex, I’m spending less money and creating more outfits using the clothes I already own ... and when I do buy a new piece, I know exactly how to integrate it into my wardrobe.
      <br><br>
      I can truly say this has been a life-changing experience for me.  I think Alex is amazing!! I think everyone can benefit from her incredible talent and expertise. I highly recommend Alex and look forward to continuing to work with her in the future!" <span class="pullquote__credit"> - M.</span>
