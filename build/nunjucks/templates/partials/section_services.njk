      A one-on-one conversation either in person, or over the phone. This is a time for us to determine your true style, outline your needs, your wants, and a budget. From that, I will make a game plan for us to review together that will bring clarity to the process.

    <p class="sub-service service__communication"><span class="title__sub-service"><em>Ongoing Communication:​</em></span> A monthly 1.5 hour at home consultation to discuss your budget, schedule, needs, and wants along with a closet refresh. This will ensure that you are constantly prepared for school events, charity dinners, luncheons, vacations, or anything else that gets thrown your way. It also ensures that you’re constantly analyzing your buys and purging what isn’t working to find the perfect balance.
    </p>

    <p class="sub-service service__shopping"><span class="title__sub-service"><em>Consistent Shopping:</em></span> A personalized shop list, based off of your seasonal mood board,  will be sent monthly,  and constantly updated, along with the usual local pull items brought to your house when applicable.  I will update you to include sales/promos to save you money when I can (you know I love a good deal!!). This will give you the option to shop at your own pace and add on a few items at a time, rather than a large shop all at once.

      We all have difficulty packing, and most women (as well as more than a few men!) are chronic over-packers. I will help you determine the pieces that will allow for maximum versatility on any trip. I’ll help eliminate the time and stress of packing and organizing your suitcase so that you can focus your pre-trip time on more important things. <span class="fake__break">Whether it’s a business trip or a beach vacation, your wardrobe will be personalized according to destination, weather forecast, and any planned events on your itinerary. Your included outfits will be pictured and outlined in order to take all of the deliberation and stress out of getting dressed, and keep your attention where it matters most.</span>

      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Custom Mood Board:</em></span>​ I will send a customized mood/styling board that will include outfit examples, proportion updates, and styling advice for us to review together.

    <p class="sub-service service__shopping-list"><span class="title__sub-service"><em>Consistent Shopping:</em></span> I will send you a personalized shop list of items for you to order at your own pace.
