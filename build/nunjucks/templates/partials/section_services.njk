      I find that this is what people struggle with the most. They are overwhelmed with the constant inspiration that they see on social media and in life and they don’t know how to integrate those looks into their reality. It’s important to have someone who can help you navigate this process with what actually works for your body type, lifestyle, personality, and budget. And that’s where I come in!

        Style Consultation
      </h4>
    </header>

    <p class="service">
      Each client is completely different, as are their needs, so every appointment is completely customized to fit that individual. I tailor my services to work specifically for each client’s budget, needs, and wants. The consultation is a one-on-one conversation either in person, or over the phone. This is a time for us to determine your true style, outline your needs, your wants, and a budget. From there, I will prepare a game plan for us to review together that will bring clarity to the process.

    <p class="sub-service service__purging">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Purging:​</em></span> Closet purging is a necessary step that I see all too often for clients who have difficulty getting dressed. This step can sometimes be difficult to accomplish on your own, simply because we all have sentimental connections to items which can limit our ability to let go. Together we will go through and establish which pieces are no longer serving a purpose for you and then decide whether to donate, consign, or alter.
    </p>

    <p class="sub-service service__organization">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Closet Organization:</em></span>​ Sometimes the issue can be as simple as your closet not being organized correctly to help you get dressed efficiently. This is usually an easy fix that everyone can benefit from to transform the experience of getting dressed from overwhelming, to stress free and enjoyable.

      We all have difficulty packing, and most women (as well as more than a few men!) are chronic over-packers. I will help you determine the pieces that will allow for maximum versatility on any trip while eliminating the time and stress of packing and organizing your suitcase so that you can focus your pre-trip time on more important things.

    <p class="service">
      Whether it’s a business trip or a beach vacation, your wardrobe will be personalized according to destination, weather forecast, and any planned events on your itinerary. Your included outfits will be pictured and outlined in order to take all of the deliberation and stress out of getting dressed, and keep your attention where it matters most.
