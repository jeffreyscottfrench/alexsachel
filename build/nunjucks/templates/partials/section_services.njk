      A one-on-one conversation either in person, or over the phone. This is a time for us to determine your true style, outline your needs, your wants, and a budget. From that, I will make a game plan for us to review together that will bring clarity to the process.

    <p class="sub-service service__purging"><span class="title__sub-service"><em>Purging:​</em></span> Closet purging is a necessary step that I see all too often for clients who have difficulty getting dressed. This step can sometimes be difficult to accomplish on your own, simply because we all have sentimental connections to items, which can limit our ability to let go. Together we will go through and establish which pieces are no longer serving a purpose for you, and then decide whether to donate or consign.

    <p class="sub-service service__wardrobing"><span class="title__sub-service"><em>Wardrobing​:</em></span> Outfitting can be a major benefit for clients who have busy lifestyles and just don’t have the time to think about assembling a cohesive outfit every morning. It’s also a great way to help those who want a little guidance in improving their current favorite ensembles, or a push to step out of their box completely with something new. <span class="fake__break">This step can be done in your closet together if your schedule permits, or I can easily prepare some choices and present them to you for review in home or at a store. I will organize a picture book of head to toe outfits for all occasions (work, vacation, date night, event dressing, etc.) to make dressing a stress free and confidence boosting experience.</span>

    <p class="sub-service service__organization">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Closet Organization:</em></span>​ Sometimes the issue can be as simple as your closet not being organized correctly to help you get dressed efficiently. This is usually an easy fix that just about everyone can benefit from to transform the experience of getting dressed from overwhelming, to stress free and enjoyable.

      If we determine that you need some new pieces to fill in the holes in your wardrobe, then shopping is the next step! This can be done with or without you, and we can shop locally, out of town, or online. These specifics can be established in your consultation, and will be tailored to suit your style, as well as your lifestyle goals. After shopping we will have a fitting to decide what works, what doesn’t, what needs to be tailored, and what will work best in your current wardrobe.

      We all have difficulty packing, and most women (as well as more than a few men!) are chronic over-packers. I will help you determine the pieces that will allow for maximum versatility on any trip, and I’ll help eliminate the time and stress of packing and organizing your suitcase, so that you can focus your pre-trip time on more important things. <span class="fake__break">Whether it’s a business trip or a beach vacation, your wardrobe will be personalized according to destination, weather forecast, and any planned events on your itinerary. Your included outfits will be pictured and outlined in order to take all of the deliberation and stress out of getting dressed, and keep your attention where it matters.</span>
