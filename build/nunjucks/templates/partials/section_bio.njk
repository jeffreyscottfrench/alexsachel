      ACS Style Consulting launched two years ago in Chattanooga, TN and has now grown into a second office based in San Antonio, TX. I started my business after acquiring over a decade of experience in the luxury retail industry in NYC, while working hand in hand with women who I would see become instantly transformed after a simple outfit change. I knew that a full service styling agency was not only necessary outside of a big city, but also nearly impossible to find in smaller markets... until now!

      With ACS Style Consulting, I focus on building and organizing every client's wardrobe to better suit their unique daily needs and lifestyle. Services for both men and women include closet organization, seasonal personal shopping, event styling, travel packing, closet design, and much, much more. <span class="fake__break">We strive to not merely outfit clients while taking the stress out of dressing, but more importantly to educate them along the way so that they can develop a deep understanding of their own personal style and gain confidence through that understanding. To me, the <em>why</em> is critically important in meeting both of these needs.

      I strive to educate each client on how to dress for their body type as well as their unique proportions, how to dress for their profession and maintain age-appropriateness while modernizing, how to streamline & mazimize efficiency, and most importantly how to confidently recognize and develop their own personal style.
