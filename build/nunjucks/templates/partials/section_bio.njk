    <span class="first-letter">W</span>hile studying fashion merchandising in NYC and engrossing myself in every possible internship in the industry, I found myself truly most intrigued by the retail world. I loved the combination of working with beautiful clothes while also being able to develop personal relationships with customers. I felt a real connection to the job in the same way I felt about working in my family’s diner while growing up.

    After years of managing luxury retails stores in NY, and freelance styling on the side, I felt the need to move on and make a new path for myself. I made the move to Chattanooga, TN to be closer to family and quickly fell in love with the ease, comfort, and friendliness of the city. While managing and buying for a local boutique, I finally had the realization that while I did enjoy the retail world, what really pulled me in were the people. I LOVED the customers and I loved the clothes. My favorite part of every day was sitting and talking with people and getting to know their stories. I had lost sight of this in the hustle and bustle of New York.

    Styling has always been a joy of mine (just ask my saint of a mother who did the laundry for my 5 outfit changes a day as a child.) It was my way of expressing myself creatively which was a great source of confidence. Once working in retail I found that I had the ability to not only style myself, but also style others, and more importantly bring them the same sense of confidence. Nothing had ever felt so fulfilling to me as seeing a woman, or man, come into the store in a slump and leave a completely different, better version inside and out, of themselves.

    I truly believe in the transformative power of a great outfit. Whether you want to feel confident for an interview, empowered for a big business meeting, comfortable and cute for school drop offs, or anything else that life throws your way, the right outfit can make all of these things easier to accomplish.
