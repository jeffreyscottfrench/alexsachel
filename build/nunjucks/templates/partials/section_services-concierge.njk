    <p class="sub-service service__communication">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Ongoing Communication:​</em></span> a monthly consultation to discuss your budget, schedule, needs, and wants along with a closet refresh. This will ensure that you are constantly prepared for school events, charity dinners, luncheons, vacations, or anything else that gets thrown your way. It also ensures that we are constantly analyzing your buys and purging what isn’t working to find the perfect balance.
    </p>

    <p class="sub-service service__shopping">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Consistent Shopping:</em></span> A personalized shop list based off of your seasonal mood board will be sent monthly, and constantly updated, along with the usual local pull items brought to your house when applicable. I will update you to include sales / promos to save you money when I can (you know I love a good deal!!). This will give you the option to shop at your own pace and add on a few items at a time, rather than a large shop all at once.
    </p>

    <p class="sub-service service__styling">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Continued Styling:</em></span>​ A monthly at home or virtual 2 hour fit / styling appointment when your shopping list arrives to cultivate killer looks and gather pictures for your future reference.
    </p>

    <p class="sub-service service__availability">
      <span class="title__sub-service"><em>Constant Communication:</em></span>​ You can text, FaceTime, or call whenever for help in a pinch! Whether you’re getting dressed in the morning for work, in the evening for date night, or need an interview outfit, I’ll make myself available to get you where you need to go looking and feeling your best!
