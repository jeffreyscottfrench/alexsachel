        <span class="faq__abbreviation">Q:</span>How long do appointments generally take?
      </h4>
    </header>

    <p class="faq__answer">
      <span class="faq__abbreviation">A:</span>Each appointment is on a case by case basis. The consultation is the time in which we can best determine the length of each appointment, however, I generally block out 3-5 hours for purges and 2-4 hours for styling/fit sessions.

        <span class="faq__abbreviation">Q:</span>What do you do with my donated items?
      </h4>
    </header>

    <p class="faq__answer">
      <span class="faq__abbreviation">A:</span>I am available to take the heavy lifting out of donation drop offs and consignments for an additional hourly charge. I am a supporter of the Northside Neighborhood House (​https://www.nnhouse.org/​ ) and usually do donations there and will provide you with your tax donation form. I have great relationships with several consignment outlets and we can together determine the best source for your gently used items.
