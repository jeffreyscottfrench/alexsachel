    <p class="faq__answer">
      <span class="faq__abbreviation">A:</span>Each appointment is on a case by case basis. The consultation is the time in which we can best determine the length of each appointment, however, I generally block out 3-5 hours for purges and 2-4 hours for styling/fit sessions.

        <span class="faq__abbreviation">Q:</span><em>Do you charge for travel time?</em>
      </h4>

    <p class="faq__answer">
      <span class="faq__abbreviation">A:</span>Yes and No. I generally don’t charge extra for travel within Chattanooga, unless travel time exceeds 30 Minutes. For locations in Chattanooga, beyond 30 minutes, an additional $45 fee will be added to your invoice. Travel beyond 30 minutes will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

      </h4>

    <p class="faq__answer">
      <span class="faq__abbreviation">A:</span>I am available to take the heavy lifting out of donation drop offs and consignments for an additional hourly charge. I am a continuing supporter of the <a href="https://www.nnhouse.org/" target="_new" title="Northside Neighborhood House">Northside Neighborhood House</span> <span class="no__break">( www.nnhouse.org )</span> </a>and usually do donations there and will provide you with your tax donation form. I have strong relationships with several local consignment outlets, and also partner with a luxury consigment service to maximize and expedite your return on these valuable, though gently used items.
